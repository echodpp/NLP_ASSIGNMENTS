# TEXT Generation
*Input: A corpus. we want to preserve the order of the text, including pinctuation.
*Python: Nothing special here. We are going to use Markov Chains to do this,
and we can implement this using Python's built-in functions.
*Output: Our goal is to generate new comedy routines in the style of each
comedian. This is more of a fun side project, but it's a cool way to look at the
data and it has applications outside of text analysis.
